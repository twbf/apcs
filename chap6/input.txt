I have one hundred conjugation charts for Spanish class due tomorrow. Conjugation charts have the word in Spanish and definition in English at the top and then six different conjugations and their respective pronouns below, approximately twenty handwritten pages of work. I take out a piece of paper and a pen, but every time I start to put the black ink to the paper my hand reflexively jerks at the task of one hundred repetitions of the same tedious task that Iâ€™ve already mastered. Learning? No. How do I make it learning? If I could just get something to repeat this task for me, I would at least learn how to solve problems like this one in the future. Computers do a fast job at repeating mundane tasks. I start by typing for(int i = 0; i < numWords; i++, which is a loop that goes through the words. My mind separates the task into taking off the ending, adding the end conjugations one by one. Then putting each conjugated word onto the correct spot in a table. This is creativity even though it is not artwork.
I understand that I will have to do this again with a different set of Spanish words which have different conjugation rules. Creativity is developing a novel solution to a problem. In this case the general solution is a sophisticated algorithm. Making my program work for a wide variety conjugation tasks requires deep thinking skills. For instance, I must store the ending conjugations in a way that makes them expandable for
